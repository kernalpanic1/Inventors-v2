			<h1>1. Welcome to Inventors.</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					This page explains our terms of use. When you use Inventors, you’re agreeing to all the rules on this page. Some of them need to be expressed in legal language, but we’ve done our best to offer you clear and simple explanations of what everything means — hence the brief summaries in these blue boxes. The summaries, for the record, are not part of the official legal terms.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				Welcome to Inventors. By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by Inventors, you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “Terms”). You’re also agreeing to our <a href="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Community Guidelines and rules for starting projects.
				<br>
				We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email. New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively — we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep using Inventors after a change, that means you accept the new terms.
				<br>
				Inventors is for your personal, non-commercial use.
			</p>
			</div>
			<h1>2. About Creating an Account</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					You’re responsible for your account and all the activity on it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
				<p>
					You can browse Inventors without registering for an account. But to use some of Inventors functions, you’ll need to register, enter email adress, and set a password. When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Don’t impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive or that violate anyone’s rights. If you don’t follow these rules, we may cancel your account.
					<br>
					You’re responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential. If you find out that someone’s used your account without your permission, you should report it to <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h1>3. Things You Definitely Shouldn’t Do</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					This section is a list of things you probably already know you shouldn’t do — lie, break laws, abuse people, steal data, hack other people’s computers, and so on. Please behave yourself. Don’t do this stuff.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
				<p>
					Many of people use Inventors. We expect all of them to behave responsibly and help keep this a nice place. Don’t do any of these things on the Site:
					<ul>
						<li><p>
							Don’t break the law. Don’t take any action that infringes or violates other people’s rights, violates the law, or breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							Don’t lie to people. Don’t post information you know is false, misleading, or inaccurate. Don’t do anything deceptive or fraudulent.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							Don’t offer prohibited items. Don’t offer any rewards that are illegal, violate any of Inventors’s policies, rules, or guidelines, or violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							Don’t victimize anyone. Don’t do anything threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, tortious, obscene, profane, or invasive of another person’s privacy.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							Don’t spam. Don’t distribute unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material, or any junk mail, spam, or chain letters. Don’t run mail lists, listservs, or any kind of auto-responder or spam on or through the Site.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							Don’t abuse other users’ personal information. 
						</p></li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					We also need to make sure that the Site is secure and our systems function properly. So don’t do any of these things — most of which boil down to “don’t mess with our system.”
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>
						Don’t try to interfere with the proper workings of the Services.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						Don’t bypass any measures we’ve put in place to secure the Services.
					</p></li>
						<li><p>
						Don’t try to damage or get unauthorized access to any system, data, password, or other information, whether it belongs to Inventors or another party.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						Don’t take any action that imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure, or on our third-party providers. (We reserve the right to determine what’s reasonable.)
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
						Don’t take apart or reverse engineer any aspect of Inventors in an effort to access things like source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms.
					</p></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			</div>
			<h1>4. How Projects Work</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					Most of our Terms of Use explain your relationship with Inventors. This section is different — it explains the relationship between enterprenuer and investor, and who’s responsible for what. This is what you’re agreeing to when you share or invest a idea.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				Inventors provides a funding platform for creative projects. When a entrepreneur posts a project on Inventors, they’re inviting other people to form a contract with them. Anyone who invest a project is accepting the entrepreneur’s offer, and forming that contract.
				<br>
				Inventors is not a part of this contract — the contract is a direct legal agreement between entrepreneurs and their investors.
			</p>
			</div>
				<h1>5. Stuff We Don’t Do and Aren’t Responsible For</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					We don’t oversee projects’ performance, and we don’t mediate disputes between users.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				Inventors isn’t liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the Services. We don’t become involved in disputes between users, or between users and any third party relating to the use of the Services. We don’t oversee the performance or punctuality of projects, and we don’t endorse any content users submit to the Site. When you use the Services, you release Inventors from claims, damages, and demands of every kind — known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed — arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and the Services. All content you access through the Services is at your own risk. You’re solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.
			</p>
			</div>
				<h1>6. Other Websites</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					If you follow a link to another website, what happens there is between you and them — not us.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				Inventors may contain links to other websites. (For instance, project pages, user profiles, and comments may link to other sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We don’t control or endorse those sites.
			</p>
			</div>
				<h1>7. Your Intellectual Property</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					We don’t own the stuff you post on Inventors. But when you post it, you’re giving us permission to use or copy it however we need in order to run the site, or show people what’s happening on it. (We generally just use this to promote projects and showcase our community on the website.) You’re responsible for the content you post, and you’re vouching to us that it’s all okay to use.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				Inventors doesn’t own content you submit to us (your “Content”). But we do need certain licenses from you in order to perform our Services. When you submit a project for review, or launch a project, you agree to these terms:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							We can use the content you’ve submitted. You grant to us, and others acting on our behalf, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right to use, exercise, commercialize, and exploit the copyright, publicity, trademark, and database rights with respect to your Content.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							When we use the content, we can make changes, like editing or translating it. You grant us the right to edit, modify, reformat, excerpt, delete, or translate any of your Content.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You won’t submit stuff you don’t hold the copyright for (unless you have permission). Your Content will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Any royalties or licensing on your Content are your responsibility. You will pay all royalties and other amounts owed to any person or entity based on your Content, or on Inventors hosting of that Content.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You promise that if we use your Content, we’re not violating anyone’s rights or copyrights. If Inventors or its users exploit or make use of your submission in the ways contemplated in this agreement, you promise that this will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including (without limitation) any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							You’re responsible for the stuff you post. All information submitted to the Site, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom that content originated.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							We’re not responsible for mistakes in your content. Inventors will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			</div>
			<h1>8. Inventors Intellectual Property</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					The content on Inventors is protected in various ways. You do have the right to use it for certain personal purposes, but you can’t use it for anything commercial without getting permission first.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				Inventors’s Services are legally protected in various ways, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other rights and laws. You agree to respect all copyright and other legal notices, information, and restrictions contained in any content accessed through the Site. You also agree not to change, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of the Service.
			</p>
			</div>
			<h1>9. Deleting Your Account</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					You can delete your account at any time. Deleting your account won’t make content you’ve already posted go away.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				You can terminate your account at any time. All provisions of this agreement survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content you’ve already submitted to the Site. (For instance, if you’ve launched a project, deleting your account will not remove the project from the Site.)
			</p>
			</div>
			<h1>10. Warranty Disclaimer</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					We work hard to provide you with great services, but we can’t guarantee everything will always work perfectly. This site is presented as-is, without warranties.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				You use our Services solely at your own risk. They are provided to you “as is” and “as available” and without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
			</p>
			</div>
			<h1>12. Indemnification</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					If you do something on Inventors that winds up getting us sued, you have to help defend us.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="terms">
			<p>
				If you do something that gets us sued, or break any of the promises you make in this agreement, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other legal costs) that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of Inventors. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to this indemnification clause, in which case you agree that you’ll cooperate and help us in asserting any defenses.
			</p>
			</div>
			<h1>13. Limitation of Liability</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					If something bad happens as a result of your using Inventors, we’re not liable.
				</p>
			</div>
				<h1>14. The Rest</h1>
			<div class="blue">
				<p>
					These are our official terms and our rules for how things work. (So if you ever see confusing or conflicting information about any of this stuff, just check these terms — they’re the last word.) Thanks so much for reading them, and for using Inventors!
